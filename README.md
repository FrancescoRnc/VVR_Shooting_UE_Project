# VVR Shooting!

I'm making a VR Game using Unreal Engine v4.24, mixing Blueprint and C++ programming.  
My goal is to publish this game for Oculus Quest and PC VR.

## Description

I'm still thinking about various kinds of mechanics and assets, but generally:  
In this game you need to shoot to some enemies in order to get the best score as possible.  
You don't need to move around the place, but it's important to have 360Â° vision because,  
sometimes, you'll be surrounded by ugly foes!

## Plans for the future

Unfortunately, i'm just a programmer, and i don't know how to make meshes, textures, audio and other assets in order to make this game pretty to watch, so i'm forced to use some external assets for the moment. First of all i need to plan new Gameplay mechanics, make them, and then optimize all.
